I recently read Manage Your Day-to-Day created by the good folks  at Behance. Check it out on Amazon [here](http://www.amazon.com/Manage-Your-Day---Day-Creative/dp/1477800670/). It was a welcome recommendation from one of my colleagues, and one of the few books I’ve actually felt compelled to take notes on based on the content. Below are my notes on the book, the passages and ideas that really hit a chord with me. Following my notes are personal recommendations for _me_, though I thought it could potentially help readers, as well:

**Manage ****your**** Day-to-Day**

_Build your routine, find your focus, and sharpen your creative mind._

_ _

**Forword**

by Scott Belsky (founder of Behance)

- There are so many distractions, it sometimes seems like you’re “at the mercy of everything around me.”
- Stop blaming your surroundings and start taking responsibility.
- It’s important as a team to step back and discuss the  work process, to “retool your doing” on a regular basis
- The biggest problem we face is “reactionary workflow”
- Audit the way you work and _fix_ it. (For me, this is reminiscent of an analytics audit)

## Ch.1 Building a Rock Solid Routine

**Laying the Groundwork for an Effective Routine**

by Mark McGuiness (author of Resilience)

- If you want to create something worthwhile with your life, you need to draw a line between the world’s demands and your own ambitions (deep, bro)
- Switch to creative work first, reactive work (emails, anything that can wait) second. That means blocking off a large chuck of time every day for creative work on your own priorities, with phone & email off.
- It may feel uncomfortable or get some people upset, but don’t surrender your dreams for an empty inbox
- Set up a routine, triggers
- Capture every commitment you make (Evernote?)
- Establish start and stop points in your day

**Harnessing the Power of Frequency**

by Gretchen Rubin (the Happiness Project)

- “A small daily task, if it be really daily, will beat the labors of a spasmodic Hercules” – Anthony Trollope
- By doing something _every_ day, you keep momentum giong
- “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” -Aristotle
- Habit leads us toward our goals much more so than sprints

**Honing your Creative Practice**

by Seth Godin (the Seth Godin)

- Find a consistent place to do your work
- It’s hard to tell others you _know_ what you’re doing because it opens you up to criticism and you’ll likely feel like a fraud at first

## Ch. 2 Finding Focus in a Distracted World

**Scheduling in Time for Creative Thinking**

by Cal Newport (Georgetown Prof.)

- We work in a paradoxical world where we’re expected to focus but also be available all the time
- How much of this expectation is in our own head?
- Create daily “focus blocks”, booked on your calendar
    - People are used to the idea that they cannot demand your attention during times when you already have a scheduled appt.
    - Never allow distraction in those times
    - Consider a different physical location for “focus blocks”

**Banishing Multitasking from our Repertoire**

by Christian Jarret (Psychologist)

- Creative minds are highly susceptible to distraction
- Remove all distractions when focusing (mostly email, phone, and social media)
- Try not to leave tasks unfinished, they will eat at you (nom!)

**Understanding our Compulsions**

by Dan Ariely (Duke Psych. Prof)

- Tthe morning is usually your most productive time but many people waste it on email, which many times doesn’t require as much focus
- Calendars inherently represent tasks that can fit into half-hours or hours, not something large like a 50-hr project
- Email & social media is exciting because of random reinforcement. Usually emails are pretty boring, but once in a while, we get really exciting ones
- Out of sight, out of mind
- “Creation is in part merely the business of foregoing the great and small distractions.” – E.B. White

**Learning to Create Amidst Chaos**

- Preserve unstructured time

## Ch. 3 Taming Your Tools

## Ch. 4 Sharpening Your Creative Mind

## Key Takeaways:

- Ch 1 Building a Rock Solid Routine
    - Great work before everything else
        - Do your most meaningful creative work at the beginning of the your day, and leave “reactive work” – like responding to email or other messages for later

    - Jump-start your creativity
        - Establish “associative triggers” – such as listening to the same music or arranging your desk in a certain way that tell your mind it’s time to get down to work

    - Feel the frequency
        - Commit to working on your project at consistent intervals – ideally every day – to build creative muscle and momentum over time

    - Pulse and pause
        - Move rhythmically between spending and renewing your energy by working in ninety-minute bursts and then taking a break

    - Get lonely
        - Make a point of spending some time alone each day. It’s a way to observe unproductive habits and thought processes, and to calm your mind

    - Don’t wait for moods
        - Show up, whether you feel inspired or not

- Ch 2 Finding Focus in a Distracted World
    - Defend your creative time
        - Book time on your calendar for uninterrupted, focused work – and respect those blocks of time as you would any client meeting

    - Focus when you’re fresh
        - Tackle the projects that require “hard focus” early in your day. Self-control – and our ability to resist distractions – declines as the day goes on

    - Kill the background noise
        - Turn off your phone, email, and any apps unrelated to your task. Event he presence of background activity (and temptation) can drain your focus

    - Make progress visible
        - Marking progress is a huge motivator for long-term projects. Make your daily achievements visible by saving iterations, posting milestone, or keeping a daily journal

    - Give your brain a break
        - Alternate challenging creative work with more “mindless” tasks to give your brain time to rest and refuel

    - Tap into transitional moments
        - Take a break from checking your smartphone during transitional moments, and open yourself up to opportunity and serendipity

- Ch 3 Taming Your Tools
    - Keep the long view in view
        - Post your complex, long-term goals by your workstation to keep them top of mind when prioritizing your tasks

    - Be conscious of your bandwidth
        - Practice letting go of certain email and social media conversations. There will always be more opportunities than you actually can take on

    - Check yourself, or wreck yourself
        - Distinguish between compulsive and conscious behaviors. Are you acting out of boredom or blind habit when you could be serving a higher goal?

    - Hit the reset button
        - Make a ritual of unplugging on a regular basis. Turning everything off is like hitting the ‘reset’ button on your mind – it gives you a fresh start.

    - Don’t hold your breath
        - Be conscious of your body. Breathing deeply and regularly can decrease your stress levels and help you make better decisions.

    - In imagination we trust
        - Don’t trust technology over your own instincts and imagination. Doing busywork is easy; doing your best work is hard

- Ch 4 Sharpening Your Creative Mind
    - Practice unnecessary creation
        - Use personal creative projects to explore new obsessions, skills, or ways of working a low pressure environment

    - Wander lonely as a cloud
        - Make time for your mind – and body – to wander when you’re stuck. Disengaging from the problem allows your subconscious to do its work

    - Define “finished” from the start
        - Keep your inner perfectionist in check by defining what finished looks like at the beginning of a project. And when you get there, stop!

    - Don’t go on autopilot
        - Repetition is the enemy of insight. Take unorthodox – even wacky – approaches to solving your stickiest problems and see what happens.

    - Search for the source
        - When the well runs dry, don’t blame a lack of talent. Creative blocks frequently piggyback on other problems. See if you can identify them.

    - Love your limitations
        - Look at constraints as a benefit, rather than an impediment. They activate our creative thinking by upping the ante.

 

For me, here are _my_ top personal takeaways:

- Get up early – all the greats, do it
- Have set time for email, SM, and phone and set them aside when it’s not that time – out of sight, out of mind
- Plan out time for necessary work (usually at the beginning of day/week) and leave time to be creative
- Take walking breaks to get a change of scenery and get some fresh air/perspective
- Wind down at night – take a walk before moving to bed, and don’t stay up late unnecessarily

Here are some ideas on what I’m planning to do more of:

- Running/racquetball
- Writing
- Language practice (German, French)
- Coding
- Marketing (projects like SocialPiq, FindSalsaDancing.com, etc)
- Ambidextrous practice – writing w/ opposite hand
- Illustration
- Practice guitar
