I did it! I finally made the move to the faster, simpler, more secure, and cheaper alternative, Jekyll. All it took was a little elbow grease.

After years of hosting my Wordpress site on a Bluehost server. I'm not particularly technical, but I was able to switch things over relatively painlessly.

- Github repo (private)
- Host main site GitHub pages (?)
- Add Favicon (may already be a way to do this in Jekyll itself)

- Host images s3 bucket – nope, just optimized them and hosted them in my own repo
- DNS using Cloudflare
- HTTPS through GitHub pages (yay!)
- Migrate site
- Create 301 redirects

- Add GA
- Add Disqus for comments (may already be a way to do this in Jekyll itself)

First things first – what's [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)? Jekyll is a Static Site Generator, or SSG.
