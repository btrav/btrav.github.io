After years of hosting my Wordpress site on a Bluehost server, I finally made the move to a faster, simpler, more secure, and cheaper alternative, Jekyll. All it took was a little elbow grease.

I'm not particularly technical, but I was able to switch things over relatively painlessly.

First things first â€“ what's [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)? Jekyll is a Static Site Generator, or SSG.
