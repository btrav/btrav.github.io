It's been a couple months since I wrote about the last leg of our long-term travel, so after having some more time to process and celebrating another trip around the sun, here's a more holistic reflection.

For context, half through last year, my wife and I started the "Travis Traverse," our long-term travel sabbatical that lasted about 7 months, taking us to lots of new places. As ardent travel planners, we decided to put ourselves outside of our comfort zone and travel without planning far ahead, starting with work exchanges and dogsitting gigs. Despite a global pandemic, we knew it was the right time to do this trip.

We've both experienced growing up as expats and have traveled a fair amount, so we felt prepared for the journey. We're glad we had that experience, since there were definitely some challenging times, though most of our travel was surprisingly smooth. Our previous travels have left important impressions on us, and after holing up in Colorado for more than a year, we were ready to hit the road again.

Fortunately, we'd been saving for a long time and were in a position to both take time off of work, something which we were extra grateful to be able to do. We planned to get to know places a few weeks at a time, with shorter "fast-travel" stints in between. Visiting friends and family along the way was a great way for us to both reconnect with folks we hadn't seen in a while and also to ground us.

We ended up learning a ton about ourselves and each other. Even after years of marriage and quarantine, we continued to learn about one other,  especially our communication styles and understanding priorities. I absolutely couldn't have done this trip without my wife -- she rocks <3

We also learned so much experiencing different cultures, learning new languages, appreciating nature, and eating lots of tasty food! I shared this in an earlier post, but it's one of my favorite quotes, so here it is again:

"Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime." - Mark Twain

The Travel
----------

We had more than a few adventures in our travels, covering more than a dozen US states and almost as many countries in Europe and Latin America. It's hard to pin down any "favorite" moments, but I'm particularly grateful for the people who helped us along the way, learning to both slow down and adapt, and my wife's support throughout the trip.

If you'd like to read about the stories in more detail, here are some links to more detailed blog posts that include my experiences like white knuckle driving in Ireland, finding long-lost relatives in Italy, and taking tango lessons in Argentina (or my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/btravs/) for the cliffsnotes version):

Preparation
-----------

Traveling for months on end was new for us, so there were a few things we learned that helped us avoid major issues along the way.

Budgeting was a big focus for us. We ended up traveling pretty cheaply most of the trip, save for a splashier Caribbean vacation and some longer flights we ended up booking last-minute. We logged most expenses in a spreadsheet and made adjustments based on our planned expenditures. Buses and flights within Europe were particularly cheap, so we were able to come in significantly under budget on transportation costs.

For our work exchanges, we used [Workaway](https://www.workaway.info/), which wasn't super intuitive at first but ended up working out well. For dogsitting/housesitting, we used [Trusted Housesitters](https://www.trustedhousesitters.com/), which was easy to use. Note that both of those services are paid but well worth it if you use them, even at least once -- and if you use them, make sure you get as much information from hosts and only commit if you're comfortable. We never felt unsafe, but it did pay off to have backup plans. Feel free to read my other posts to get details about those experiences.

Too Good to Go was a great app to use in cities -- they pair food establishments who have extra food at the end of shifts with folks who are more flexible with their food choices to reduce food waste. We ended up getting full meals for just a few Euros on plenty of occasions.

Navigating languages was mostly straightforward. Between my German and my wife's Spanish, we only really ran into issues trying to speak Brazilian Portuguese. To keep languages fresh, I used Duolingo (and managed to get my 365 daily streak!). It was a great exercise in empathy.

Navigating new cities can be imposing, so I used Wikivoyage as a starting point and contacted friends or family who either lived nearby or had visited before for additional recommendations. Downloading offline Google Maps also proved to be super helpful, especially when we drove.

Healthwise, we used SafetyWing for insurance. They had good reviews online, and I was recovering from a blood clot for the first part of the trip, so I wanted to be extra careful, and things got better over time. I also coped with daily yoga routines and travel adjustments.

Somehow we managed to dodge covid on our trip despite a ton of travel. We mostly wore KN-95 masks indoors and on public transportation, especially during the Omicron surge. When we ate out, we almost exclusively ate outside. We also adopted an EU vaccine app that made travel super simple. Fortunately, we were both able to get boosted in the middle of our trip, which allowed us to continue traveling.

For travel gear, we both opted for a backpack and carry-on. Since we were originally planning for more extreme colder weather, we also shipped a larger suitcase to family overseas and swapped our wardrobes in the middle of the journey.

Overall, we found that the best preparation was understanding how long we could feasibly travel -- financially, physically, and mentally. We learned to prioritize what we needed -- not to prove anything to anyone but ourselves.

Parting Thoughts
----------------

When we wrapped up our travels earlier this year, we both let out a sigh of relief after getting back. We'd experienced so much and grown together. We were immensely grateful for the past few months that expanded our perspective, acknowledging that very few people have the opportunity to take this kind of travel in their early 30s.

Still, the trip was exhausting, and it took a couple months to find our footing again. We still had plenty to do when we got back to the US -- find a home, get jobs, figure out insurance, and move across the country etc., and lots to process.

That said, it was nice to start a new, more settled chapter after our sabbatical. There were plenty of things that we appreciated about being abroad, but there's also so much we were thankful for. Thankful for being stateside, thankful for having more than 5 outfits to wear for months on end, and thankful for a place to sleep that didn't change every couple of weeks.

We're excited to start our new adventure in Richmond, Virginia! After settling into our home, we recently adopted a dog and both found jobs that we're excited about. We're also closer to family, even though we'll miss our friends in Colorado. How apt that we're doing this all in the season of Spring.

Here's to new beginnings!
