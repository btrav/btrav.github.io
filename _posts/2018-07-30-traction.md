I just read [Traction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22091581-traction) by Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares, and as a marketer, I'd highly recommend it. Every now and then, I'm so engrossed by content that I write down meticulous notes so I (hopefully) remember the subject matter better than I would otherwise. [Sometimes]({{ site.url }}/blog/taking-back-you-life) I share those notes, like now, in the hope that others will get some value out of it and I'll be able to easily reference them later.

For some quick background on the book, the two authors have pretty extensive experience in the digital marketing space. Gabriel Weinberg is the Founder and and CEO of [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), and Justin Mares is an industry growth marketer and entrepreneur. The book covers 19 marketing channels, as well as a 3-step framework dubbed Bullseye.

The main premise is that teams should quickly and effectively find ways to get getting real customers/users onboard. Traction is a key business metric, and one that dictates the success of fundraising, hiring, press, partnerships, and acquisitions. [The Lean Startup](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10127019-the-lean-startup) could be considered the seminal book for startup product development. Likewise, Traction bills itself as the same for product marketing – [Hacking Growth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31625067-hacking-growth) makes a similar claim.

Anyway, let's dive in:

## <a name="ch1"></a>Chapter 1 – Traction Channels

Traction is defined as a sign that your company is taking off. This could be app downloads, subscriptions, signups, etc. The aim of a startup is to grow rapidly, and Traction is evidence of that growth.

>"Traction is basically quantitative evidence of customer demand." -Naval Ravikant

The authors lay out 19 channels called "traction channels" that are referenced throughout the book, each also having their own chapter. It's hard to know which one will perform best until you run tests, which is central to the Bullseye framework. Here they are:

* [Targeting Blogs](#ch6)
* [Publicity](#ch7)
* [Unconventional PR](#ch8)
* [Search Engine Marketing (SEM)](#ch9)
* [Social & Display Ads](#ch10)
* [Offline Ads](#ch11)
* [Search Engine Optimization (SEO)](#ch12)
* [Content Marketing](#ch13)
* [Email Marketing](#ch14)
* [Engineering as Marketing](#ch15)
* [Viral Marketing](#ch16)
* [Business Development](#ch17)
* [Sales](#ch18)
* [Affiliate Programs](#ch19)
* [Existing Platforms](#ch20)
* [Trade Shows](#ch21)
* [Offline Events](#ch22)
* [Speaking Engagements](#ch23)
* [Community Building](#ch24)

Measured by sales/signups, it's important to quickly and effectively exploit the channels that prove most promising. Why quickly? Often, what works in one growth stage eventually stops working.

## <a name="ch2"></a>Chapter 2 – Traction Thinking

>"The number one reason that we pass on entrepreneurs we'd otherwise like to back is they're focusing on the product to the exclusion of everything else." -Mark Andreessen

Traction and product development are of equal importance. The authors go so far to say that 50% of time should go to product development with the other 50% to traction (note the product bend here...). Many companies die because they don't have good distribution strategies.

How do you not just survive but thrive? Use results from your traction experiments to guide you constantly. Getting traction early on can actually help your development since you're constantly getting _new_ feedback. New info from traction should inform your product creation as well as your distribution strategy.

Thank about what traction means for your company before jumping in too deep. Set a traction goal and look for something that **moves the needle**. That's phrase that gets used quite a bit in the book. Moving the needle basically means to focus on growth activities that result in a significant (and measurable) impact on your business goal.

There are basically three phases of working on a product:
* Phase I – Make something people want.
* Phase II – Market something people want.
* Phase III – Scale business.

Traction will look different for each phase. Phase I often entails getting traction in ways that don't scale like giving talks, writing guest posts, and emailing your network. When you're at Phase II, you should have product-market fit. Phase III is about fueling your growth engine efficiently.

Takeaways from this section are putting equal amounts of effort into product development and traction, setting your growth goals (and I'd argue getting the right system in place to accurately measure), learn what growth numbers potential investors respect, and find your bright spots (read:highly engaged customers).

## <a name="ch3"></a>Chapter 3 – Bullseye

It's the whole selling point of the book. Bullseye, the framework, helps you find the channel to get the best traction. Think of three concentric rings – outer, middle, and inner. This framework basically lays out a way of coming up with a lot of growth strategies, testing them, testing them again, then putting your weight behind the most effective method.

Bullseye is meant to be a straightforward way to direct traction and focus to maximize results. It forces you to take all traction channels seriously.

### The Outer Ring

Think of at least one idea for every channel that has a chance to move the needle
Understand how similar companies acquired customers over time.

### The Middle Ring

Run cheap tests in channels that seem most promising. Use the best "outer ring" ideas and promote them to the middle ring. Keep the number low but more than one. In other words, pick 3-4 great ideas to test.

The test should answer three things:

1. How much will it cost to acquire customers through this channel?
2. How many customers are available through this channel?
3. Are this channel's customers the kind we want?

Your main consideration is to get data to prove or disprove assumptions. Your test should cost _at most_ $1,000 and take a month to run.

### The Inner Ring

Focus on the channel that will best move the needle for your startup. This is your **core channel**. At any stage in a startup's lifecycle, one traction channel dominations in terms of customer acquisition. At the inner ring, your goal is to wring every bit of traction out of your core channel.

Note that often one channel is domination but others feed into it(e.g. SEO fed by publicity).

### Takeaways

* Determine your outer ring and move inwards, testing along the way. Keep in mind that when companies really take off, they * usually employ underutilized channels and channel strategies.
* "If you build it, they will" come is _always_ wrong.
* Talk to founders a few steps ahead of you.
* Hold on to your other channel ideas for your next phase.

## <a name="ch4"></a>Chapter 4 – Traction Testing

A channel strategy is a particular way to acquire customers within a channel. Continuous testing these channels and their strategies is the key to getting traction with Bullseye.

Example:
* *Traction Channel* – Offline ads
* *Channel* – Billboards, transit ads, magazine adsense

Be sure to ask similar questions about channel strategies as you did about the channels:
1. How much is it to acquire each customer?
2. How many customers are available?
3. Are these the right kind of customers?

The first channel strategy tests are often cheap and short – think $250 on Google Ads. The inner ring tests help to optimize channel strategies and uncover better channel strategiest within a particular traction channel. Running A/B tests is ideal once you have the volume for them.

Eventually, tactics that once worked will become crowded and ineffective. To combat this, constantly brainstorm new channel strategies and conduct experiments. Become a marketing mad scientist!

Once you've got a core traction channel, it's helpful to brainstorm how you could use the other 18 channels to support that one.

>"Don't start testing until your tracking and reporting system has been implemented" -Sean Ellis

This. So much.

Using a spreadsheet to help you rank and prioritize traction channel strategies is a good step to take. Some metrics to measure at the very least: available customers, cost per acquisition, lifetime value (LTV). For more on testing metrics, check out [UX + CRO = PROFIT](https://www.viget.com/articles/ux-cro-profit-how-to-use-your-ux-skills-to-improve-conversion-rates-part-one/) from my Albert and Laura over at Viget.

Takeaways:
* Look for customers where others aren't looking.
* Constantly optimize
* Keep it numerical

## <a name="ch5"></a>Chapter 5 – Critical Path

How do you decide to work on?

Always have an explicit traction goal to work toward. The right goal should be chosen carefully and align with your company strategy. Once that goal has been identified, you can work back ward and set subgoals (e.g. monthly growth goals).

And now the concept of "Critical Path" – **Critical Path** is the path to reaching your traction goal with the fewest number of steps.

To follow the critical path, first enumerate the intermediate steps (aka milestones) to get to your traction goal. Then, cut out all unnecessary steps – you can't afford to waste what little resources you have.

## <a name="ch6"></a>Chapter 6 – Targeting Blogs

A lot of bloggers have loyal audiences but don't make money from their writing. Creating partnerships with niche blogs can help you highly target existing engaged audiences. Run tests on small blogs, either by sponsoring or offering authors (and their audiences) early access/discounts.
